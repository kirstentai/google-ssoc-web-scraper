# Google SSoC Web Scraper
This is a web scraper to collect the list of open-source organisations that participated in Google SSoC from 2016-2020 (2015 and further have a different website layout).

This was used to check which organisations have been consistently participating, and helps those interested in the program to make earlier research.

`scrape.py` - scrapes organisations names from the website. To use, change '2020' in URL to desired year.
